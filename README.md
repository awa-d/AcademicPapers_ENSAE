Welcome to my academic papers repository!

This space hosts selected works from my academic journey in the ISE program at ENSAE, including research papers, project reports. Each file corresponds to a specific paper, with links provided for easy access and citation. Iâ€™ll be continuously updating this repository as I publish or finalize new work.

Feel free to explore, cite, or reach out with questions or collaborations.
Best,
